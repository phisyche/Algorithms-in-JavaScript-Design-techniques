Backtracking is the technique to solve a problem recursively by making series of choices and if any of the choice fails we abandon the choice and try a different one.

Given a problem statement, you will be making decision-making calls(recursion) with given choices and constraints. If decision doesn't work, step back and make another decision with different choice.
