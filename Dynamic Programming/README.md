Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.

-Identifying a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming:

A problem needs to be broken down into smaller subproblems.
Problem demads for optimal solution.
