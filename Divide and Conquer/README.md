The Divide and conquer technique solves a problem by dividing it into little easily solvable  subproblems and conquering those subprobles by solving them recursively the combining the result.

A problem to be solved by the divide conquer technique is identified if it generates two or more subproblems of same kind that can be solved recursively and then combined back for a global result. Examples include merge sort, quick sort and binary search.

Problem 01: Merge Sort
- Sorting and array through dividing the array into smaller halves until you can't divide the array any longer.
